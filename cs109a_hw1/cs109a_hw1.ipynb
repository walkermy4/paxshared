    "- `my_page.text`, \n",
    "- `my_page.status_code`,\n",
    "- `my_page.content`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2** Create a Beautiful Soup object named `star_soup` using `my_page` as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3** Write a function called `parse_stars` that accepts `star_soup` as its input and generates a list of dictionaries named `starlist` (see definition below; order of dictionaries does not matter). One of the fields of this dictionary is the `url` of each star's individual page, which you need to scrape and save the contents in the `page` field. Note that there is a ton of information about each star on these webpages.\n",

    "page: BS object with html text acquired by scraping the above 'url' page' \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4** Write a function called `create_star_table` which takes `starlist` as an input and extracts information about each star (see function definition for the exact information to be extracted and the exact output definition).  Only extract information from the first box on each star's page. If the first box is acting, consider only acting credits and the star's acting debut, if the first box is Directing, consider only directing credits and directorial debut.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5** Now that you have scraped all the info you need, it's good practice to save the last data structure you created to disk. Save the data structure to a JSON file named `starinfo.json` and submit this JSON file in Canvas. If you do this, if you have to restart, you won't need to redo all the requests and parsings from before.  \n",

    "**2.6** We provide a JSON file called `data/staff_starinfo.json` created by CS109 teaching staff for consistency, which you should use for the rest of the homework. Import the contents of this JSON file  into a pandas dataframe called `frame`. Check the types of variables in each column and clean these variables if needed. Add a new column to your dataframe with the age of each actor when they made their first appearance, movie or TV, (name this column `age_at_first_movie`). Check some of the values of this new column. Do you find any problems? You don't need to fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.7** You are now ready to answer the following intriguing questions: \n",
    "- **2.7.1** How many performers made their first appearance (movie or TV) when he/she was 17 years old?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2.7.2** How many performers started as child actors? Define child actor as a person younger than 12 years old. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.8** Make a plot of the number of credits against the name of actor/actress. Who is the most prolific actress or actor in IMDb's list of the Top 100 Stars for 2017? Define **most prolific** as the performer with the most credits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "- Create a variable that groups actors/actresses by the age of their first movie. Use pandas' `.groupby` to divide the dataframe into groups of performers that for example started performing as children (age $<$ 12). The grouped variable is a `GroupBy` pandas object and this object has all of the information needed to then apply operations to each of the groups.\n",
    "- When cleaning the data make sure the variables with which you are performing calculations are in numerical format.\n",
    "- The column with the year has some values that are double, e.g. **'2000-2001'** and the column with age has some empty cells. You need to deal with these in a reasonable fashion before performing calculations on the data. \n",
    "- You should include both movies and TV shows.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Resources\n",

Regular expressions are useful to parse strings, text, tweets, etc. in general (for example, you may encounter a non-standard format for dates at some point). Do not use BeautifulSoup to answer this problem.\n",

    " **3.1** Write a function called `get_pubs` that takes an .html filename as an input and returns a string containing the HTML page in this file (see definition below). Call this function using `data/publist_super_clean.html` as input and name the returned string `prof_pubs`. \n",

    "- Look for patterns in the HTML tags that reveal where each piece of information such as the title of the paper, the names of the authors, the journal name, is stored. For example, you might notice that the journal name(s) is contained between the &lt;I&gt; HTML tag. \n",
    "- Learning about your domain is always a good idea: you want to check the names to make sure that they belong to actual journals. Thus, while journal name(s) is contained between the &lt;I&gt; HTML tag, please note that <i>all</i> strings found between &lt;I&gt; tags may not be journal names.\n",
    "- Each publication has multiple authors. \n",
    "- `C.M. Friend` also shows up as `Cynthia M. Friend` in the file.  Count just `C. M. Friend`. \n",
    "- There is a comma at the end of the string of authors. You can choose to keep it in the string or remove it and put it back when you write the string as a BibTex entry. \n",
    "- You want to remove duplicates from the list of journals. Duplicates may also occur due to misspellings or spaces, such as: `Nano Lett.`, and `NanoLett.` You can assume that any journals with the same initials (e.g., `NL` for `NanoLett.`) are the same journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- **Regular expressions:** a) https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/re.html, b) https://regexone.com, and c) https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html. \n",
